freehmind
=========

Implementation of Mind Mapping software using haskell.
See Freemind / FreePlane for open source mind mapping software implementations (in java).

Overview:
The functioning of freehmind will be similar to the freemind application. 
Even the file standard should match so that mind maps can be edited/opened in either of the applications.

Tasks:
  1. Create GUI front-end in GTK using Diagrams library.
    a. Render the mind map.
    b. Add interactivity to modify the mind map.
  2. Create XML parser and writer for .mm files.
